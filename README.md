# X-ray-Image-Segmentation

Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for medical image segmentation using MRI and X-ray data.
Implemented U-Net architecture to identify disease-affected regions in clinical images.
Preprocessed datasets and evaluated performance using Dice coefficient and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) metrics.
Built and trained the model in Python using TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
